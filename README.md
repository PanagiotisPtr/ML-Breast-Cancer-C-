Quick Implementation of a slightly augmented Adaline Model to predict whether tumor is malignant (-1) or benign(1)


This is a very simple implementation of an ADAline model where I have added hyperbolic tangent as an activation function so that I
can get somewhat decent results. The Model, although simple, manages to get around 87% accuracy on the training dataset. 

This project was mostly an experimentation and isn't meant for production.

I hope that you will find it helpful and educational.
